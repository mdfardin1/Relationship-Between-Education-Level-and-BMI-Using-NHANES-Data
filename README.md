Analyzing the Relationship Between Education Level and BMI Using NHANES Data

Overview:

This project investigates the association between educational attainment and Body Mass Index (BMI) using data from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2021–2023. The analysis explores how education level correlates with BMI indicators and weight loss efforts among U.S. adults, providing insights into the role of education in weight-related health outcomes.

Project Highlights:

Dataset: NHANES 2021–2023, comprising over 7,600 U.S. adults.

Objective: Examine how educational attainment impacts BMI and weight management efforts.

Key Findings: Higher education levels are associated with healthier BMI outcomes, reflecting trends in health literacy and resource accessibility.

Steps Involved:

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing data and filtered relevant variables (education, BMI, weight loss efforts).

Processed raw NHANES data for accurate and consistent analysis.

Descriptive Analysis:

Examined distributions of education levels and BMI indicators.

Computed summary statistics for BMI and weight variables.

Inferential Analysis:

Conducted Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test to identify significant variations in BMI across education levels.

Used cross-tabulation to explore bivariate relationships between education and BMI indicators.

Weight Loss Efforts

Analyzed weight loss trends across BMI categories.

Data Visualization

Created tables and visualizations using ggplot2 to illustrate findings.

Tools & Technologies:

Languages & Libraries: R, ggplot2, dplyr

Dataset: NHANES (2021–2023)

Software: RStudio, Excel

Results:

Individuals with lower education levels showed higher proportions of overweight and obesity.

Higher education levels correlated with healthier BMI outcomes.

Obese and overweight participants were more likely to engage in weight loss efforts.
